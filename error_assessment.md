# Annotator Disagreements

1. Title: "PGWP winter 2025 batch"

Annotators categorized this as "Admissions", "Work & Research", "Work & Research"

- The confusion here is because it is not clear what PGMP is to the annotators. Two annotators assumed it to be a club leading to the majority "Work & Research" label. The other annotator likely focused on "2025 batch" which does have a admissions connotation.

2. Title: "Do you study on Friday night ?"

Was labelled "Leisure & Lifestyle", "Academic", and "Leisure & Lifestyle" by the annotators.

- The confusion what the fact the post mentioned "studying" which is academic but implied the topic of passtimes as the overall theme which points to "Leisure & Lifestyle".

3. Title: "Lab coat"

Was labelled "Academic", "Life and Resources", and "Academic".

- The disagreement likley stems from lab coats being a required part of academic courses, but also a clothing item that could be discussed in the context of purhcasing resources.

4. Title "FG Building"

Was labelled "Academic", "Leisure & Lifestyle", and "Course Specific".

- There really is not context at all for this building in the title. Annotators assumed its purpose. In the end we made a forced choice for this to be labelled Academic
